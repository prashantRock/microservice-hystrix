# microservice-hystrix

A typical distributed system consists of many services collaborating together.

These services are prone to failure or delayed responses. If a service fails it may impact on other services affecting
performance and possibly making other parts of application inaccessible or in the worst case bring down the whole application.

Of course, there are solutions available that help make applications resilient and fault tolerant â€“ one such framework is 
Hystrix.

The Hystrix framework library helps to control the interaction between services by providing fault tolerance and latency 
tolerance. It improves overall resilience of the system by isolating the failing services and stopping the cascading effect 
of failures.

Currently we have circuit breaker added

TODO: to use it as Cache ie rather then sending all same x requests further just send 1 request
